## Discussion

Starting out, my program was really messed up with layering and trying to get things to layer over eachother the correct way that I wanted, eventually I got help from Joey about how to layer things correctly and then I was able to do it the correct way. 


I tried to change the music from "All I want for Christmas Is You" to a different song that I pulled off of Youtube and used a Youtube to MP3 converter, but when I saved it to the "songs" part of the code and use it, it gave me an error code and I just decided to stick with the Mariah Carrey song. This also happened with the pictures of the Beechcraft Denali and Denali National Park. Instead of saving the picture to my computer and in the "Images" folder, I just copied the image address and refernced it in my code.

Creating the snowman was fairly easy, I created the hat first because I figured it woule be the hardest to style and get the size right so I would just build the snowman around the hat. I originally wanted the snow to cover the whole screen but when I put it twice, it didn't reach the whole screen and when I did it three times, it had the page scroll down to put the snow.

- I used ChatGPT to find common bugs in the code such as typos in common words
- I also used Joey for some ideas about how to layer things correctly
